# Maggie Allen

Word Nerd turned Junior Developer.

And just like that, I fell in love with coding. The culture of agile working, failing fast, sharing often and working collaboratively clicked with me. Not to mention the infinite possibilities to build and shape the world that coding offers. So I signed-up for a incredible, intensive Makers Academy bootcamp.

In four months Iâ€™ve worked my way from code newbie to capable junior developer with the ability to write
clean, maintainable and extendable code and following best practices. And I've never been happier.

I'm now looking for my first Junior Developer role as part of an empowered team of engineers sharing my passion for agile who want to make the world more awesome.

## Skills

#### Communication Queen

I'm a qualified linguist and a self-confessed communcation junkie. My ability to understand people and explain complex ideas simply has been an asset as I learned to code. I honed this skill while working with children's media which involved being sensitive to the needs of unique users and producing tons of targeted content.

#### Clean Coder

Makers Academy inspired in me a passion for building great software well. Syntax can be googled, but the instinct to test-drive code and follow the SOLID principles cannot. During my studies I've been singled out as an excellent pair partner and praised for my commitment to testing, committing often and maintaining a positive focus while collaborating.


#### Endlessly Curious

I'm a quick and enthusiastic learner. Having joined my previous company during a period of upheaval I delved into the role, quickly becoming the team's expert in a new content publishing system and the go-to tech guru. I aim to learn and improve by just 1% every day - which quickly adds up!

#### Conscientious Problem Solver

I love the process of talking through puzzles, breaking them down into their logical parts and building amazing solutions. When building a backend API for my Makers final project, I co-designed clean, readable, refactored code from scratch and got to see it work smoothly in our team's final project.

#### Detail Driven

Having excellent attention to detail was key in my role as an editor and proofreader. I was often the last person to see a book before it was printed and responsible for ensuring it was error-free. Now, the ability to quickly spot syntax errors has become a superskill in my debugging toolkit.
