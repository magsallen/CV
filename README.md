## Maggie Allen

Word Nerd fell in love with coding. The culture of agile working, failing fast, sharing often and working collaboratively clicked with me. So I signed-up for a four-month intensive Makers Academy bootcamp.

In four months Iâ€™ve transformed from code newbie to capable junior developer with the ability to write
clean, maintainable and extendable code, following best practices and ... And I've never been happier.

I'm now looking for my first Junior Developer role as part of an empowered team of engineers who share my passion for agile and want to make the world more awesome.

## Skills

#### Communication

I'm a qualified linguist and a self-confessed communcation junkie. My ability to understand people and explain complex ideas simply has been an asset as I learned to code. I honed this skill while working with children's media as it involved being sensitive to the needs of unique users and producing targeted content.

#### Endlessly Curious

The environment of continuous learning is one of the most exciting aspects of software development. Having joined my previous company during a period of upheaval I quickly became the team's expert in a new content publishing system and the go-to tech guru. I aim to learn and improve by at least 1% every day - which quickly adds up!

#### Problem Solver

Puzzles are awesome. I love the process of talking through puzzles, breaking them down into their logical parts and building integrated systems which solve user needs. When building the No Parks After Dark backend API, I designed clean, readable, refactored code from scratch and got to see it work smoothly in our team's final project.

Having excellent attention to detail was key in my role as an editor and proofreader. I was often the last person to see a book before it was printed and responsible for ensuring it was error-free. Now, the ability to quickly spot syntax errors has become a superpower in my debugging toolkit.

#### Best Practice

Makers Academy inspired in me a passion for building great software well. Syntax can be googled, but the instinct to test-drive code and follow the XP principles cannot. During my studies I've been singled out as an excellent pair partner, and praised for my commitment to testing, committing early and often and maintaining a positive focus while collaborating.
