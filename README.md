## Maggie Allen
**Junior Developer**

An former publishing professional who fell in love with coding. The culture of agile working, failing fast, sharing often and working collaboratively clicked with me; so I took on an intensive Makers Academy bootcamp.

In the few months since, Iâ€™ve worked my way from code newbie to capable junior developer, writing clean, maintainable and extendable full-stack web systems. And I've never been happier.

I'm now looking for my first Junior Developer role with an empowered team of skilled engineers who share my passion for agile and want to make the world more excellent.

### Skills

### Quality Effective Communication

I'm a qualified linguist and a self-confessed word-nerd. My ability to understand people and explain complex ideas simply make me an excellent communicator. I honed this skill while working with children's media as it involved being sensitive to the unique needs of users in each age-bracket and producing targeted content.

### Endlessly Curious

The environment of continuous learning is one of the most exciting aspects of software development. I'm a quick learner; having joined my previous company during a period of upheaval and quickly became the team's expert in a new content publishing system and the go-to tech guru. As a developer, I aim to learn and improve by just 1% every day - which quickly adds up!

### Problem Solver

I love the process of talking through puzzles, breaking them down into their logical parts and building integrated systems which solve user needs. When building the No Parks After Dark backend API, I designed clean, readable, refactored code from scratch and got to see it work smoothly as part of the larger app.

As an editor and proofreader, having excellent attention to detail was key. I was often the last person to see a book before it was sent to print and responsible for making sure it was error-free. As a developer, the ability to quickly spot syntax errors has become an invaluable part of my debugging toolkit.

### Best Practice

Makers Academy inspired in me a passion for building great software well. Syntax can be googled, but the instinct to test-drive code and follow the XP principles cannot. During my studies I've been singled out as an excellent pair partner, and praised for my commitment to testing, committing early and often and maintaining a positive focus while collaborating.
